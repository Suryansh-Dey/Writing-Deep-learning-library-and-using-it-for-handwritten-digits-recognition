# Writing-Deep-learning-library-and-using-it-for-handwritten-digits-recognition
WARNING: NeuralNetworks library uses the convention of storing array of format {array_size, element_1,...., element_(array_size-1)};
for eg: if wanna an array like { 1,2,3 } to some function of this library then you have to modify it in above mentioned format which will be like: {4,1,2,3}
Anything else will raise and error or may lead even to segmentation fault!!
